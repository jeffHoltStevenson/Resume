# Leadership
Organized engineering leader with years of experience deploying software to highly available clusters and millions of desktops. Track record of growing the skills and trust of product and engineering. Strong ability to balance business and engineering needs and communicate the tradeoffs. I bring the calm to the choppy waters of software delivery without compromising quality of life while keeping customers smiling.
